## 👋 Hey, there,

Wecome to the workspace of **The Universal Programming Langauge**!!!

## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction
We can't use one langauge for everything. Unv is a attempt to make a simple one for this purpose. With simple syntax similar to python , it can be used for any task.

**Here's a taste of UNV :**

```py
import 'print' from 'standard'

if 'Unv is awesome!'
    print('Hello World!')
```


## 🌈 Contribution guidelines
Unv is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the [team](https://github.com/orgs/UnvLabs/people)!
See our [guidelines](https://github.com/UnvLabs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#readme) to start contributing.
> Currently UNV is under development
