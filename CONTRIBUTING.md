* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one(‚òùÔ∏è goto issues tab and tap _new_ button). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

  * **Feature request**

* Before submitting, please read the Contributing to Unv(üëâ this document) guide to know more about coding conventions.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Unv will generally not be accepted (read more about [rationales behind this decision on another project](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).
